## Project Description
This project recreates a pre-1990 Urdu newspaper front page using only HTML. The layout was designed to resemble the historical structure of the Al-Islah newspaper, including masthead placement, vertical notice strip, multi-column layout, and dense article formatting. All content was translated and rephrased into English to maintain originality.

## Features Implemented
- HTML5 document structure with proper DOCTYPE
- Semantic layout using header, section, table-based columns
- 3-column newspaper layout using HTML tables
- Vertical text strip using inline CSS (`writing-mode`)
- Masthead with logo placement
- War emblem image below headline
- Dense justified newspaper-style text
- Inline CSS for styling (no external CSS used)
- Proper heading hierarchy and comments

## Challenges Faced
Recreating a historical newspaper layout using only HTML was challenging, especially replicating vertical Urdu-style text and dense column formatting. These were addressed using table layouts and inline CSS properties such as `writing-mode` to simulate the original design.
